Continuing a rewrite by toally changing how the ears are done. I didn't like the headpart nonsense, and it can now be removed! 

Added a "testing" folder which contains my experiments in trying to get this to work, and testing various methods.

Rebuilt the main plugin (again), from what I should have done since the beginning, which was to use the original MaTera plugin from Oldrim and merge things into it.

Decided to throw out the node based method.

Merged the racemenu options into the main plugin, as what was the point in having it be technically optional, but required to be able to change anything in game.
